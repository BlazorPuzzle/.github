# Welcome to the Blazor Puzzle repository!

This is a repository of repositories for the Blazor Puzzle podcast show on YouTube.  Your hosts Carl Franklin and Jeff Fritz share a new puzzle for you each week that you can find right here on GitHub.  Each puzzle might be to find a bug, fix an issue, or write some code to complete a feature.  If you solve the puzzle correctly and send your solution to Carl + Jeff before the next episode, you could be selected to win a prize for that episode.

Each episode starts with a recap and discussion of the previous puzzle's solution and then introduces the next puzzle to be solved.

Check out our growing collection of puzzles and let us know how many YOU can solve:
