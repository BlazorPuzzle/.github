# Welcome to the Blazor Puzzle repository!

This is a repository of repositories for the Blazor Puzzle podcast show on YouTube.  Your hosts Carl Franklin and Jeff Fritz share a new puzzle for you each week that you can find right here on GitHub.  Each puzzle might be to find a bug, fix an issue, or write some code to complete a feature.  If you solve the puzzle correctly and send your solution to Carl + Jeff before the next episode, you could be selected to win a prize for that episode.

Each episode starts with a recap and discussion of the previous puzzle's solution and then introduces the next puzzle to be solved.

A random winner is chosen for each puzzle and will be awarded a Blazor Puzzle Mug

Repositories with puzzles are marked as archived to keep the state of the puzzle intact for all puzzle solvers.
